The attached 14 pdb structures were used as starting structures for the BAT-calculations. The naming is composed as follows: ligandname_proteinconformation.pdb. A total of 7 ligands are present (RMM25, RMM24, RMM23, RMM22, RMM21, RMM4 and RMM15) and the two protein conformations are open and closed.
The initial structures were converted into complete simulation boxes using the command line: "python BAT.py -i input-dd-amber.in -s equil".
